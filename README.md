# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-using-mini-max-

Welcome to my tic tac toe game, I made it in just a weekend so it's not the best nor prettiest game ever, but I am still proud of it. it was hard to make because  
I decided not to follow any tutorial or step by step guid because I whanted to practice my coding skills so I had to figure everything out by myself and figure out 
how to implement everything. I first whent learning about minimax and after that i started coding it out. so here it is. Hope you like it. 

oh and I added a board with a started game into the Brain class in main.py which is optional but speeds things up a bit otherwise it will take several minutes

PS. It is not possible to win the AI, because he is going through every possible way the game could end 255168 possible games to be precise, excluding symmetry
